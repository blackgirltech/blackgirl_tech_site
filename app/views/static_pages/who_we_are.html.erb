  <p class="f2-l fw3-l f4 "><span class="courier">blackgirl.tech</span> started in 2014 as an organisation that aimed to provide a safe space for black girls and women in the tech industry and those coming into the tech industry. Since then, it has grown into a social enterprise that not only provides a safe space for black women, but that aims to make tech a safer space for black women and girls. We now run a blog, a podcast and events.</p>

  <p class="fw3-l f2-l f4 pink-local">
    The goal of blackgirl.tech isnâ€™t to make everyone a coder but to introduce coding to those who may have never been exposed and to create an environment that fosters sharing, learning and growth.
