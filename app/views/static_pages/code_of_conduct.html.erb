  <p class="f3">
    blackgirl.tech workshops are a safe space for black women and non-binary people to learn and explore technology. We use positive discrimination because we see a need for more black women and non-binary people in the UK tech industry. Some of our events will be open to others, and those events will be labeled as such. Apart from the previously mentioned positive discrimination, blackgirl.tech does not discriminate based on age, sexual orientation, religion, ability or socioeconomic status. In order that they remain safe, we have a code of conduct which we expect all volunteers and attendees to follow. A lot of it is common sense, but we also want to ensure the best possible care.
