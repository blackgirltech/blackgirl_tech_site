        <p>blackgirl.tech started in 2014 as an organisation that aimed to provide a safe space for Black* girls and women
            in the tech industry and those coming into the tech industry. Since then, it has grown into a social enterprise
            that not only provides a safe space for Black women, but that aims to make tech a safer space for Black women
            and girls.</p>

            <small class="small">* When we say Black, we are spesifically referencing those who are of African decent <b> <em> and </em></b> who identify as Black racially (including Black-British, Black Carribbean, African-American, Afro-Latinx, and Bi-racial people who have at least one Black parent).

            and to create an environment that fosters sharing, learning and growth.
